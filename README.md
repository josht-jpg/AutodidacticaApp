Here's the frontend of Autodidactica. The code's pretty rough right now, but I plan to do alot of cleaning over the coming week (as well as reading up on React best practices).

Where's the backend? The data in the app ended up being alot more relational than expected. Thus, with some hestiation, I've decided to migrate from MongoDB to Postgres. Once this is done (hopefully sometime soon), I'll make the full codebase public.  However, if you're really curious about the current Mongo implementaion, shoot me a message at joshtaylor361@gmail.com.
